I also have over 20 years of experience in computer science. I have been a computer programmer, enthusiast, and evangelist for most of my life and I continue to look for ways to expand my skills and find ways of using technology to make life a little easier for everyone.",

Fortunately, my boys have shown interest in many of the same interests that I've had over the years which makes our home a very interesting place. My wife and I (mostly my wife) homeschool our boys and it's fun to watch them as they grow and learn.",
